## 📚 What I Learned

✅ Programming logic and problem-solving with Python  
✅ Control structures and modular programming  
✅ Data manipulation with lists, dictionaries, and tuples  
✅ Object-oriented programming (OOP) — Pythonic style  
✅ Design Patterns (GoF) for advanced software architecture  
✅ Web development using Django and API creation  
✅ GUI development using PySide6 (Qt 6)  
✅ SQL database operations (CRUD, joins, relationships)

## 💻 Real Projects Developed

- 🔢 **CPF Generator and Validator**  
- 🖥️ **Graphical Interface Apps (PySide6 / Qt 6)**  
- 🌐 **Full Websites with Django**  
- 🧪 **Automated Testing Frameworks**  
- 🗄️ **Database Integration and CRUD Systems**  
- ☁️ **Deployment on Google Cloud (Linux Server + SSH Configuration)**

## 🚀 Why This Course Stands Out

- Constantly updated for new Python versions  
- Teaches **real-world applications**, not just theory  
- Includes **backend, frontend, and automation** knowledge  
- Offers **extra sections** on Regex, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Design Patterns  
- Guides you from **zero to deploying** your own applications in production

## 🏁 Conclusion

By the end of this course, I built a strong and practical foundation in Python, mastering not only the syntax but also the **architecture, testing, and deployment aspects** of professional software development.  

I’m now fully prepared to apply Python in real-world contexts — whether in automation, web development, or full-stack projects.
